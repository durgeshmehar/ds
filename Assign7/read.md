Okay, let's break down the concepts and the flow of execution for Assignment 7, based on the Java web service (`SimpleAddService.java`) that serves an HTML interface.

**Core Concepts Involved:**

1.  **Web Service:** A software component that makes its functionality available over a network (usually the internet or an intranet) using standard protocols, primarily HTTP. It allows different applications (clients) to interact with it. In this case, the service provides an addition operation.
2.  **Client-Server Architecture:** This is the fundamental model used.
    *   **Server (`SimpleAddService.java`):** Runs continuously, listens for incoming requests on a specific network address and port (e.g., `localhost:8000`), processes these requests, and sends back responses. It *provides* the service.
    *   **Client (Web Browser):** Initiates requests to the server to use its services. In this version, the web browser acts as the client, rendering the HTML UI and executing JavaScript to interact with the server's API endpoint.
3.  **HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol):** The standard protocol used for communication between web browsers and web servers. The assignment uses HTTP GET requests.
4.  **API (Application Programming Interface):** The `/add` endpoint defined in the service acts as the API. It's the specific contract defining how a client should request the addition operation (i.e., send a GET request to `/add` with `num1` and `num2` as query parameters).
5.  **HTML (Hypertext Markup Language):** Used to structure the user interface (input fields, button, result area) that is displayed in the web browser.
6.  **JavaScript:** Runs within the web browser. It handles user interaction (button clicks), reads input values, makes requests to the web service's API endpoint (`/add`) asynchronously using `fetch`, and updates the HTML page with the results received from the service.
7.  **JSON (JavaScript Object Notation):** A lightweight data-interchange format used by the `/add` endpoint to send the calculation result back to the JavaScript running in the browser (e.g., `{"num1": 5.0, "num2": 3.0, "sum": 8.0}`).
8.  **Distributed Application:** The system consists of two main parts (the Java server process and the web browser client) that communicate over a network (even if it's just the local machine network), making it a simple distributed application.

**Flow of Execution:**

1.  **Server Startup:**
    *   You compile `SimpleAddService.java` (`javac SimpleAddService.java`).
    *   You run the compiled code (`java SimpleAddService`).
    *   The `main` method in `SimpleAddService` executes:
        *   It creates an `HttpServer` instance using Java's built-in `com.sun.net.httpserver`.
        *   It binds the server to listen on port 8000 on the local machine (`localhost`).
        *   It registers two `HttpHandler`s:
            *   `CalculatorHtmlHandler` is associated with the root path (`/`).
            *   `AddHandler` is associated with the API path (`/add`).
        *   It starts the server thread pool and the server itself. The server is now actively listening for incoming HTTP requests on port 8000.

2.  **Client Accesses UI:**
    *   You open a web browser (like Chrome, Firefox, Edge).
    *   You navigate to the address `http://localhost:8000/`.
    *   The browser sends an HTTP GET request to `localhost:8000` for the path `/`.

3.  **Server Serves HTML:**
    *   The running `HttpServer` receives the GET request for `/`.
    *   It directs the request to the registered `CalculatorHtmlHandler`.
    *   The `handle` method of `CalculatorHtmlHandler` executes.
    *   It generates the HTML content (including the form, CSS, and JavaScript) as a String.
    *   It sends an HTTP response back to the browser with:
        *   Status Code: 200 (OK)
        *   Content-Type header: `text/html`
        *   Response Body: The generated HTML string.

4.  **Browser Renders UI:**
    *   The browser receives the HTML response.
    *   It parses and renders the HTML, displaying the "Simple Addition Web Service" page with two input fields and a "Calculate Sum" button.
    *   It also parses the embedded JavaScript code, making it ready to execute upon user interaction.

5.  **User Interaction & Client-Side Request:**
    *   You enter numbers into the "Number 1" and "Number 2" input fields.
    *   You click the "Calculate Sum" button.
    *   This triggers the JavaScript `click` event listener attached to the button.
    *   The JavaScript code:
        *   Reads the values from the input fields (e.g., "10", "25").
        *   Constructs the URL for the API call: `/add?num1=10&num2=25`.
        *   Uses the `fetch` API to send an asynchronous HTTP GET request to `http://localhost:8000/add?num1=10&num2=25`.

6.  **Server Processes API Request:**
    *   The `HttpServer` receives the GET request for `/add`.
    *   It directs this request to the registered `AddHandler`.
    *   The `handle` method of `AddHandler` executes:
        *   It parses the query parameters `num1=10` and `num2=25`.
        *   It converts "10" and "25" to `double` values (10.0, 25.0).
        *   It calculates the sum: 10.0 + 25.0 = 35.0.
        *   It constructs the JSON response string: `{"num1": 10.0, "num2": 25.0, "sum": 35.0}`.
        *   It sends an HTTP response back to the browser with:
            *   Status Code: 200 (OK)
            *   Content-Type header: `application/json`
            *   Response Body: The JSON string.

7.  **Client Displays Result:**
    *   The browser receives the JSON response from the `/add` endpoint.
    *   The `fetch` API's promise resolves, and the `.then()` block in the JavaScript code executes.
    *   JavaScript parses the received JSON data.
    *   It updates the `textContent` of the `<div id="result">` element on the HTML page to display something like "Result: 10.0 + 25.0 = 35.0".
    *   The user sees the calculated result appear on the web page without the page needing to fully reload.
