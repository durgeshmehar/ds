Okay, let's break down the concepts and commands for your Leader Election assignment (`Assign6`), covering both the Bully and Ring algorithms.

**Core Concept: Leader Election**

In many distributed systems, you need one process to act as a central coordinator or "leader" to perform special tasks (e.g., managing access to a shared resource, assigning tasks, maintaining global state).

*   **Problem:** What happens if the current leader process crashes or becomes unreachable? The system needs a way to detect this failure and elect a new leader from the remaining active processes.
*   **Goal:** Leader election algorithms provide a mechanism for processes in a distributed system to agree on a new leader when the current one fails.

**1. Bully Algorithm (`Assign6/Bully.java`)**

*   **Concept:** This algorithm assumes each process has a unique ID (priority). When a process notices the coordinator is down, it tries to elect itself by "bullying" processes with lower IDs and deferring to processes with higher IDs. The highest-ID active process always wins and becomes the new coordinator.
*   **How it Works (General Steps):**
    1.  **Detection:** A process P detects that the current coordinator is not responding (e.g., through timeouts).
    2.  **Initiation:** Process P starts an election by sending an `ELECTION` message to all processes with *higher* IDs than itself.
    3.  **Response/Takeover:**
        *   If P receives no `ANSWER` (or `OK`) message back from any higher-ID process within a timeout period, it means all higher-ID processes are down. P declares itself the new coordinator and sends a `COORDINATOR` message to all other processes.
        *   If P *does* receive an `ANSWER` message from a higher-ID process Q, P knows it cannot be the leader. P stops its election attempt and waits for Q (or another higher-ID process) to eventually send a `COORDINATOR` message.
    4.  **Recursive Election:** When a process Q receives an `ELECTION` message from a lower-ID process P, Q sends an `ANSWER` message back to P (telling P to stop) and then starts its *own* election by sending `ELECTION` messages to processes with IDs higher than Q.
    5.  **Outcome:** This process continues until the active process with the highest ID initiates an election, receives no `ANSWER` messages (because no one has a higher ID), declares itself the coordinator, and notifies everyone else.
*   **Your Code (`Assign6/Bully.java`):**
    *   `processes[]`: A boolean array tracking the status (up/down) of each process. Process IDs are 1-based, so `processes[i]` corresponds to process `P(i+1)`.
    *   `coordinator`: An integer storing the ID of the currently recognized coordinator. Initially set to the highest possible ID (`max_processes`).
    *   `upProcess(int process_id)` / `downProcess(int process_id)`: Methods to simulate a process coming up or going down by changing its status in the `processes` array.
    *   `runElection(int process_id)`: This method simulates the election process initiated by `process_id`.
        *   It tentatively sets the `coordinator` to the initiating `process_id`.
        *   It iterates through processes with higher IDs (`i` from `process_id` up to `max_processes - 1`).
        *   It prints a message simulating sending an election message (`"Election message sent from process " + process_id + " to process " + (i+1)`).
        *   If it finds a higher-ID process `i` that is currently up (`processes[i]` is true), it simulates that higher process taking over:
            *   It prints that the message was received and stops its own attempt (`keepGoing = false`).
            *   It recursively calls `runElection(i + 1)` to simulate the higher process starting its own election.
        *   If the loop completes without finding any active higher-ID process, the `coordinator` variable retains the value of the highest-ID process that initiated an election in this chain, effectively becoming the new leader.
    *   `main()`: Provides a text-based menu to:
        *   Create processes (initialize the simulation).
        *   Display the status of processes and the current coordinator.
        *   Mark processes as up or down.
        *   Trigger an election initiated by a specific process.

**2. Ring Algorithm (`Assign6/Ring.java`)**

*   **Concept:** Processes are arranged in a logical ring. When a process detects the leader has failed, it starts circulating an `ELECTION` message around the ring. This message collects the IDs of all active processes. Once the message completes a full circle, a new leader is chosen (usually the process with the highest ID from the collected list).
*   **How it Works (General Steps):**
    1.  **Detection:** A process P detects the coordinator is down.
    2.  **Initiation:** Process P creates an `ELECTION` message containing its own ID and sends it to its successor in the ring.
    3.  **Circulation & Update:** When a process Q receives an `ELECTION` message:
        *   It adds its *own* ID to the list within the message.
        *   It forwards the updated message to *its* successor.
    4.  **Completion:** The message circulates around the ring. When the message arrives back at the original initiator P:
        *   P sees its own ID already in the message list, indicating the message has completed the circle.
        *   P now has a list of IDs of all active processes that participated.
    5.  **Selection & Announcement:** P (or sometimes all processes upon receiving the completed list) examines the list, identifies the process with the highest ID, and recognizes that process as the new coordinator. The initiator (or the new leader itself) then circulates a `COORDINATOR` message containing the ID of the new leader around the ring.
*   **Your Code (`Assign6/Ring.java`):** (Based on typical implementations, as the code isn't shown)
    *   It likely maintains an array or list representing the processes and their status (up/down).
    *   It needs logic to determine the successor of any given node in the ring (e.g., for node `i`, the successor is `(i + 1) % n` where `n` is the number of processes, skipping over downed processes).
    *   The election function would simulate passing a message (perhaps represented by an `ArrayList` of IDs) from one active node to its next active successor.
    *   Each node would add its ID to the list before forwarding.
    *   The initiating node would detect when the message returns and then find the maximum ID in the list to determine the new coordinator.
