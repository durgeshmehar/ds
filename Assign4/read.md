Okay, let's break down the concepts and commands for your Berkeley algorithm assignment (`Assign4`).

**Core Concepts Involved:**

1.  **Clock Synchronization:** In distributed systems, each computer has its own clock. These clocks aren't perfectly accurate and tend to drift apart over time. Clock synchronization algorithms aim to keep the clocks across different machines in the system reasonably close to each other. This is crucial for ordering events, coordinating actions, and ensuring consistency.
2.  **Berkeley Algorithm:**
    *   **Master-Slave Architecture:** This algorithm uses a centralized approach. One node is designated as the *master* (or time daemon/server), and the other nodes are *slaves* (clients).
    *   **Master's Role:**
        *   Periodically polls all slave nodes to ask for their current clock time.
        *   Collects the times reported by the slaves.
        *   Calculates its own time difference relative to each slave. It might factor in estimated network communication delays (though this implementation seems to calculate a simpler difference based on receive time).
        *   Computes an *average* time based on its own time and the times received from the slaves. It often includes a fault-tolerance step where it ignores readings that are drastically different from the others (this implementation doesn't explicitly show fault tolerance, but calculates a simple average difference).
        *   Calculates the necessary *adjustment* (a positive or negative time delta) that each slave (and itself) needs to apply to reach this average time.
    *   **Slave's Role:**
        *   Responds to the master's poll with its current clock time.
        *   Receives the calculated adjustment delta (or the target time) from the master.
        *   Applies the adjustment to its local clock.
    *   **Goal:** Unlike algorithms that sync to an external "true" time source (like NTP), Berkeley aims to achieve *internal consistency* by bringing all clocks in the group to an average time agreed upon by the group members.

**How Your Code Implements It (`Assign4`):**

*   **`server.py` (Master):**
    *   `initiateClockServer`: Sets up a socket, binds to port 8080, and listens for connections. It starts two key threads: one for accepting new client connections (`startConnecting`) and one for running the synchronization cycles (`synchronizeAllClocks`).
    *   `startConnecting`: Accepts connections from clients. For each client, it starts a dedicated thread (`startReceivingClockTime`) to handle communication with that specific client.
    *   `startReceivingClockTime`: Runs per client. It continuously receives time strings sent by the client (`client.py`'s `startSendingTime`). It calculates the difference between the server's current time and the received client time (`clock_time_diff`) and stores this difference along with the client's connection object in the `client_data` dictionary.
    *   `getAverageClockDiff`: Calculates the average of all the `time_difference` values currently stored in the `client_data` dictionary.
    *   `synchronizeAllClocks`: This thread runs periodically (every 5 seconds).
        *   It calls `getAverageClockDiff` to get the average offset needed.
        *   It then iterates through all connected clients.
        *   For each client, it calculates the target synchronized time by adding the `average_clock_difference` to the server's current time (`datetime.datetime.now()`).
        *   It sends this calculated *target time* back to the client. *(Note: A pure Berkeley implementation often sends the adjustment delta, but sending the target time achieves a similar result here).*
*   **`client.py` (Slave):**
    *   `initiateSlaveClient`: Connects to the server at `127.0.0.1:8080`. It starts two threads:
        *   `startSendingTime`: Periodically (every 5 seconds) sends the client's current `datetime.datetime.now()` to the server.
        *   `startReceivingTime`: Listens for messages from the server. When it receives a time string, it parses it as the `Synchronized_time` sent by the server and prints it to the console. *(Note: This client implementation *prints* the synchronized time received from the server but doesn't actually *adjust* its own system clock or maintain an adjusted logical clock based on this information. A complete implementation would perform this adjustment.)*

**Explanation of Commands:**

1.  `python server.py` (Run in Terminal 1)
    *   `python`: Invokes the Python 3 interpreter.
    *   server.py: Tells the interpreter to execute the script named `server.py`.
    *   **Action:** Starts the master node process. The script initializes the server socket, begins listening on port 8080 for incoming client connections, and starts the periodic synchronization cycle (`synchronizeAllClocks`). This terminal will show output indicating the server has started, when clients connect, and when synchronization cycles run.

2.  `python client.py` (Run in Terminal 2, and potentially more terminals)
    *   `python`: Invokes the Python 3 interpreter.
    *   client.py: Tells the interpreter to execute the script named `client.py`.
    *   **Action:** Starts a slave node process. The script connects to the server running on `127.0.0.1` (localhost) port 8080. It then begins periodically sending its local time to the server and listening for the synchronized time updates sent back by the server. This terminal will show the time it sends and the synchronized time it receives. You can run this command in multiple separate terminals to simulate several clients participating in the clock synchronization.
